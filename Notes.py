# The average processor can process about 1 billion instructions
# per second, which is approx 1 nanosecond/instruction


#Computational problems
# Problems that have and ideal input and desired output
# There is a relationship between the input and output
# Requires a process for transforming inputs into the desired output

#Solving Computational problems
# 0. Dont Panic
# 1. Consider the Inputs
#    a. What are the inputs?
#    b. How should the inputs be represented?
# 2. Consider the Outputs
#    a. What are the desired outputs
# 3. Consider the Transformations
#    a. What is the relationship between inputs and outputs?
#    b. Write some examples (test cases)
# 4. Create simple mechanical solution (psuedocode)
# 5. Develop solution incrementally and test as you go
